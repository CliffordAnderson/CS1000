# Syllabus of CS 1000

This course introduces the fundamental concepts of computing including abstraction, algorithms, design, and distributed computation. The curriculum is hands-on, focusing on translating ideas into working computer programs and developing a mastery of practical computational literacy. We write our programs in [NetsBlox](https://netsblox.org/), a block-based language developed by a research team at Vanderbilt University. Along the way, we also discuss the history, ethics, and cultural impact of computing.  

While envisioned as an introduction to computing for non-majors, majors and prospective majors are also welcome. Students in the School of Engineering may only receive open elective credit for CS 1000.

A mirror copy of the syllabus is available on [Github](https://github.com/CliffordAnderson/CS1000).

## Learning Outcomes

1. Solve simple problems with short computer programs
2. Examine ethical and social issues arising from the increasing role of algorithms and computer software in everyday life
3. Identify the relevance of computational thinking to your particular major and fields of interest

## Class policies

### Acknowledgments

This course takes direct inspiration from the [Beauty and Joy of Computing](https://bjc.berkeley.edu/) curriculum, but also differs in significant ways, using different readings, videos, coding assignments, and programming environment.

### Ability and Disability

This class respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds, identities, and abilities. If there are circumstances that make our learning environment and activities difficult, if you have medical information that you need to share with me, or if you need specific arrangements in case we have to evacuate the building, please let me know. As I aspire to create an effective learning environment for all students, I would appreciate if you would discuss your needs with me as soon as possible. I promise to maintain the confidentiality of these discussions. If appropriate, please also contact the Vanderbilt Equal Opportunity, Affirmative Action, and Disability Services Department (EAD) to get more information about specific accommodations.

### Absences

Class participation is an important component of this course and more than two unexcused absences may negatively impact your grade. Please consult me in advance if you need to miss more than two class sessions.

### Academic Integrity

The Vanderbilt University [Honor Code](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/the-honor-system/#statement-of-the-honor-code) applies to all activities in this course. If you have any questions about how the Honor Code applies to assignments this course, please consult the instructor.

### Student Privacy

The [Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html) (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) also governs all activities this class. You will be asked to complete and submit online assignments to me and will also be sharing projects with other students in this class. If you have any concerns about digital privacy, please consult me at your earliest convenience.

### Technology

We will be using a free and open-source visual programing language called [NetsBlox](https://netsblox.org/) during the course. The sole prerequisite for using NetsBlox is a modern web browser with JavaScript enabled. You will need to bring a computing device to class to follow along with classroom exercises––any brand of laptop or a tablet should be fine. If you do not have a personal laptop or tablet at your disposal, please consult me and we will find alternative arrangements.

## Disclaimer

This syllabus provides a general outline for the course. Given that this is the first offering of this course at Vanderbilt University, the readings and coding assignments are subject to change. If I have to make substitutions, I will update the syllabus and communicate those changes during class.
