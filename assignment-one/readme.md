# Assignment One: Ticking Clock

The goal of this assignment is to create a sprite that moves on the stage like a second hand on a clock. The blocks you need are in the [project file](second-hand.xml) in this folder.

Download and drag the file onto your script area to begin. You must rearrange the blocks so that, when finished, your script looks something like the ticking second hand below.
